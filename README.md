# TRLM8620-Final
This project is my team's localized shopping website built for TRLM8620.
The original template was provided in class, and we customized the content, fixed some UI issues, and tested key e-commerce flows (homepage, product browsing, PDP, cart, checkout, etc.).

Our site is themed around sci-fi merchandise (droids, vehicles, and gear), with multiple locale and currency options.

The goal was to simulate a real multilingual shopping experience and surface common issues that appear during localization—such as layout shifts, selector rendering problems, and unsupported features.
